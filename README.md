# QuertyChecker

## Context ##
In the first year of college, they had a workshop where they thought us how to build simple games using **pygame**. It was also my first encounter with **Python** as a programing language.

After the session was concluded, they gave us an assignment, to build our own game. This is the product of that homework. It's a game that just checks if you have a querty keyboard (with some student easter eggs included in Romanian).

## Run ##
All you need to do (make sure you have **pygame** installed) is to run
`python game.py`

Enjoy!
